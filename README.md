# Plant Disease Classification Using Neural Networks
This project uses a data from the publicly available PlantVillage data set. The 20,636 images represent photos of 15 different classes of healthy and diseases crops. The images were processed and converted into arrays to be used in a convolutional neural network. The images were separated into three groups: train, test and validation. A convolutional neural network was created using categorical cross entropy as the loss function. The model was trained for 100 epochs. Accuracy is the validation metric. I used dropouts to prevent overfitting in between the layers.
